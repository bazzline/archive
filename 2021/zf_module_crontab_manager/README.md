# Zend Framework Module - Crontab Manager

This module contains the small layer of php code to manage a section in your crontab.
You can install or update a dedicated section and use variables to automatically modify your crontab based on your environment (production, stage, development, docker, vps whatever you can think of).

It supports you in managing crontabs with application dependend sections without creating a vendor locking on "how to interact with your crontab".
At any time, you will always have a crontab you can bring back to life by just removing comments.

The current change log can be found [here](CHANGELOG.md).
